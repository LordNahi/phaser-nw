# **Phaser/nw Template**  

## Installing Dependencies

This project uses [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/) to bundle everything.  
   
Install Parcel globally with `npm install -g parcel-bundler` 

Then install our project dependencies with `npm install`

## Running Your Game  

Everything can be done with the scripts defined in the package.json  

You'll need to call `npm run watch` first. This will build the project and rebuild when it detects code changes. Leave this running in the background.

In another terminal, run `npm run start` to open a window running the game.  

#
You can now make code changes and your code should be automatially updated. Simply right click on the game window and click "reload app" to see code changes.
